This program simulates how onion routing works at a basic level by creating
n numbers of routers and creating an onion packet, which will be sent through 
the routers through random hops defined in the onion packet
to transmit the mesaage from the client to the server. This program can also simulate
delays along each hop.

*We assume that for each hop the onion packet is uniquely encrypted and decrypted

To run the program, enter the following command in the terminal

python3 demo.py <# of routers> <# delay>

Ex:  python3 demo.py 10 2

This creates ten routers and simulates possible delay on each hop between 0 to 2 seconds

*Type "kill" in the terminal to kill the subprocess after each run. Or the subprocess will 
live on and causes ports in use error, which you have to run "pkill -9 python3" to kill the subprocess.
